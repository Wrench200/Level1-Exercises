    The head section is made up of a title and two links which link to the css styling page and the source for the icons used.
The Header contains three sections (left, center and right). The left section contains the logo , the center contains the search box, 
a seach icon and a mic icon and the right contains the bell and account icons.The reason why the header is like this is because i want
the youtube logo to be bigger. The header has a class which is found on the css page to determine its styling and within the header there is and an image 
sorce which has the address to the youtube logo and below that a seach bar and search button. after that we have the mic icon and then the notification 
and account icon.
